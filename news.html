                <h2>August 15th, 2021 - Heat Re-Sign UD40</h2>
                <p>The Miami Heat have resigned veteran Udonis Haslem to the roster for the 2021-2022 NBA Season. During the peak of free agency, rumors swirled around that the organization would move Haslem into a coaching position to free up a roster spot.
                    It seems after filling out the rest of the roster to Pat's liking, the Heat have resigned UD40 for another year.</p>

                <p>The Miami Heat have resigned all-star forward Jimmy Butler to a three year, $184 million contract extension. The All-NBA third team forward joined the team in July, 2019. Jimmy's place on this team is solidified in his leadership and experience.
                    His training mentality continues to push the Heat's young talent as they push for another title run.</p>

                <h2>August 02nd, 2021 - Welcome Kyle Lowry!</h2>
                <p>Heat fans are glad to see a big trade mix up the roster after the team underperformed to expectations of "running it back" after going to the NBA Finals in 2020. The deal for Lowry involved Miami sending away Goran Dragic and Precious
                    Achiuwa. Beloved by fans, many are sad to see Dragic go after his six year tenure with the team.</p>
                <p> Kyle Lowry's deal, three years, $90 million, will end when he is 38. This present-focused move implies hopeful title contention for the 2021-2022 season.</p>
